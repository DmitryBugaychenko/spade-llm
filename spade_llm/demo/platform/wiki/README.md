Assistant: Bertrand Russell was a British philosopher, logician, mathematician, and public intellectual known for being one of the founders of analytic philosophy alongside Gottlob Frege and G.E. Moore. He made significant contributions to mathematics, particularly through his work on logic and set theory, and is most famous for co-authoring *Principia Mathematica* with Alfred North Whitehead. Russell's work laid foundational groundwork for modern mathematical logic and influenced many fields of philosophy. Additionally, he played a crucial role in opposing imperialism and advocating for peace, earning him the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1950..
