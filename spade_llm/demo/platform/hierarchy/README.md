# Agent hierarchy demo

A simple demo of hierarchy with four agents:
* Chat agent - general assistant capable of looking up information in Wikipedia and delegating tasks to other assistants, uses a LLM
    * Financial assistant - can handle financial task based on mocked payment account and savings account, uses a LLM
        * Payment agent - can handle payments if there are enough funds on the payment account, does not use LLM
        * Savings agent - manages user savings and is capable of replenish payment account, but requires user confirmation passing message back to chat agent, does not use LLM
    * Wikipedia search - a build on langchain tool

To run the demo open a terminal at the root of the GitHub project and follow the steps below.

1. User asks for population of Moscow and assistant uses Wikipedia to lookup an answer
2. User asks to pay a bill and there are enough money on the payment account, request goes to financial assistant and then to payment agent
3. User asks to pay a bill and there are no enough money on the payment account, payment agent fails the operation and financial assistant asks saving agent to solve the problem, the later gets user confirmation and replenish payment account, then financial assistant goes to payment agent again and at this time its all done
4. User asks to replenish current account without specifying amount, assistant asks for clarification and proceed to operation. 

Logs are omitted to highlight dialog messages and agent decisions.
